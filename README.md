# Disease Prediction in Gujrati
## Cloud Chatbot

The proposed disease prediction chatbot can interact with the users, and give them a realistic experience of talking with a medical expert. It can be an alternative in the future to the current practice of visiting a hospital and making an appointment with a doctor to get a diagnosis. Primarily the focus is to provide assistance to the people who cannot speak or understand or read in english or hindi language but in one specific language that is gujrati. 

The Gujarati language dataset is prepared manually which includes symptoms, diseases, descriptions of diseases, reasons, treatments, and home remedies. The features considered are the Parts of Speech (POS) tag of the current word, the previous word and the next word in addition to the words themselves. The input text also undergoes POS tagging before prediction for better results. The system is designed with efficient accuracy.
